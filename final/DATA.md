Data Sources:
1. In order to find information about venues we will use Foursqare API.
2. The neighbourhoods information will be used from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M 
3. To get crime data we will use Open Data from Toronto Police Public Service http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/
4. As client would like to minimise types of pricing, we will cluster neighbourhoods and crime data by using k-means and find optimal number of clusters.
