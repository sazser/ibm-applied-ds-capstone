A new physical security firm would like to start their service in Toronto. In order to understand risks and offer adequate pricing based on the risks, they would like to have an overview over types of services per neighbourhood and their associate crime rates. The prices will depend based on the risks associated and venue type. They also would like to group those to keep price types to minimum.

As clearly states from the beginning the target audience is the security firm which is going to start their business in Toronto.
